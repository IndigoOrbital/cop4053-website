As a team, we decided that our work in trying to create an isometric game as we had originally planned wasn't being met with much success. We met up and decided that we'd try to convert the game to a tower defense game to make full of use of Unity's 3D features. We're not sure if it was because of the assets we were using or our lack of planning in trying to convert our game style that caused it, but our initial attempts to make to make a tower defense version of our game just didn't feel right. Again we met as a group and decided that converting our game style to a 2D platformer would be the best way to preserve the original feel of our game, maintain use of the art assets we had already made, and ensure our game was fun and engaging. We were on a time crunch with our first playable presentation less than a week away, so we decided to move ahead in development temporarily using freely available online assets to work on game functionality."}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:n,props:{id:o},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#state-of-the-game",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:p}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{src:".\u002Fmedia\u002Fweek-5\u002Ftower-defense-attempt.png"},children:[]},{type:b,value:"\n- [Current Game State (Week 4)](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FiDeeNZ-_WO8)\n- [3D Unity Practice](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002F8WGBb4SKh2M)\n"},{type:a,tag:n,props:{id:q},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#contributions",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:r}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{id:s},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#john",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:t}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{id:u},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#will",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:v}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{id:w},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#quynh",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:x}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{id:y},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#michaela",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:z}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:n,props:{id:A},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#media",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:B}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:l,props:{id:C},children:[{type:a,tag:d,props:{ariaHidden:e,href:"#art-concepts",tabIndex:f},children:[{type:a,tag:g,props:{className:[h,i]},children:[]}]},{type:b,value:D}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{src:".\u002Fmedia\u002Fweek-5\u002Fcave-tiles.png"},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{src:".\u002Fmedia\u002Fweek-5\u002Fplayer-sprite-complete.png"},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{src:".\u002Fmedia\u002Fweek-5\u002Fslime-initial-design.png"},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{src:".\u002Fmedia\u002Fweek-5\u002Fslime-angry-initial-design.png"},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:j,props:{src:".\u002Fmedia\u002Fweek-5\u002Fspear-attack-planning.png"},children:[]}]},dir:"\u002Fen\u002Fposts",path:"\u002Fen\u002Fposts\u002Fweek-4",extension:".md",slug:"week-4",createdAt:E,updatedAt:E,to:"\u002Fposts\u002Fweek-4"},prev:{title:"Week Three",slug:"week-3",to:"\u002Fposts\u002Fweek-3"},next:{title:"Week Five",slug:"week-5",to:"\u002Fposts\u002Fweek-5"}}],fetch:[],mutations:[]}}("element","text","\n","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link","img",3,"h3",2,"h2","state-of-the-game","State of the Game","contributions","Contributions","john","John","will","Will","quynh","Quynh","michaela","Michaela","media","Media","art-concepts","Art Concepts","2020-10-15T00:57:08.324Z")));
