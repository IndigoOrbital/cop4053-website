This website describes the development process of a simple desktop game for the COP4053 - AI For Game Programming course at UCF through the use of the Unity Game Engine.

Each week, our group members **John**, **Will**, **Quynh** and **Michaela** will be discussing their contributions and efforts made to the project by incorporating code, visual, or behavioral examples.
