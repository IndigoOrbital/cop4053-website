## Contributions

This week was a focus on getting the initial setup completed. We walked through getting perforce setup together and made some design mockups.

### John

### Will

### Quynh

With the help of Michaela and John, I managed to connect to the server and set up Perforce.

### Michaela
I deployed our AWS remote server using the free tier and set up Perforce. I made a new Unity project for our team, uploaded it to Perforce, and called a group meeting for the week to troubleshoot any Perforce issues my team members were having and ensure that everyone was properly connected to the remote server.

## Art Concepts

Here are some art concepts that Will drew up. We wanted the main character to look more androgenous and in a similar style as Don't Starve's main characters. Will also included some plants' designs.

This is the rough sketch of the final stage of the tree deity once the player has harvested all the plants.
