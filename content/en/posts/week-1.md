This week we presented our project to the class on Monday and have finalized our schedule for the subsequent weeks. The past few weeks were spent discussing the direction we wanted our project to go, floating around a few ideas using inspiration from games such as **Don't Starve**, **Oxygen Not Included**, **Stardew Valley**, and story archetypes from **Alice in Wonderland**.

## Synopsis

The game starts when the main character falls into a ruinous cave space with little to observe aside from a withered tree amidst what was once an ornate central room. Spurred to some semblence of awakening, the tree invites the unexpected guest to help foster its growth by bringing new life to the main hall. From there the character comes to realize the tree is a forgotten deity, and the only way to escape this foreign environment is to see it flourish, though that may require more dangerous acts besides simple farming.

## Contributions

The group spent this first week coming up with mock designs for the character, interface, and environment as well as John and Quynh getting acquainted with making a simple environment and controls. Michaela created a Gantt chart and designed the game proposal PowerPoint.

## Media

### Art Style Ideas

The art style being investigated is either going to be a pixel isomorphic or the gothic, Tim Burton-esque style of Klei Entertainment's Don't Starve game.

### Tree Deity

These are inspiration for the central tree character. As the game state evolves towards the win condition, the tree will grow and its roots will break open corridors once closed.
