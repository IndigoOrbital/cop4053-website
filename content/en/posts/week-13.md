In our final (full) week of development, we were able to finish up our game's third area, the lava area. The plant assets associated with the lava area were finished this week and enemy behavior was fully scripted. We added a game over screen, additional dialogue, and an official ending to our game.

I made some final fixes to our game's areas-- adding unique backgrounds and background music to each area. I also lowered the overall game volume (in response to our playtesting feedback) and wrore a few more lines of last minute dialogue for our game's tutorial for the sake of clarity.
