With our game's due date quickly closing in, we've finished production on the snowy area and begun production on the lava area. We finalized the design of the snowy area and finished scripting area's enemies. We were able to make a few quick bug fixes, such as our sometimes buggy ladders, with the help of the playtesting results. While this was going on, Will was able to create art assets for our remaining enemies and create the lava tileset.

Like most of the team, I spent my Monday studying in last-minute preparation for our exam. I met with everyone else to pitch some ideas for our playtesting iteration plan and was able to show a few videos of bugs that our playtesters were able to catch. I spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to replicate the bug where the player gets stuck in the floor, and we're still not entirely sure what exactly causes it. I completed a rough initial area design for the lava area on the tilemap using the tileset from Will.
