This week we had a quiz on Monday, as well as an exam next Monday, so we focused on doing some basic work on the menu and lock down some key design concepts for the inventory items and map. We made some minor progress in the creation of our game's main Unity scene but our game was still riddled with bugs. Few of us were familiar with Unity and none of us knew anything about isometric game design, of which the latter was difficult to find reliable resources of information for.

## Contributions

### John

### Will

### Quynh
This week I followed some tutorials on setting up tilings and character's sprites. I set up a temporary grass tile and a main scene to get use to Unity as well as committing changes to Perforce.

### Michaela
This week was a bit of a down week for me. I remained active on Discord and communicating ideas and concepts with my teammates and kept myself available for troubleshooting, but I wasn't able to make any demonstratable progress aside from updating our Gantt chart to reflect our current progress.
