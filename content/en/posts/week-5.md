This week we presented our first playable iteration of our project to the class over Zoom. Our team finally settled on a 2D platformer playstyle for our game. We're happy that we've finally arrived on the right track and satisfied with how game production is going (although we'll have to speed it up).

This week I put a lot of focus into completing our UI assets before our first playable presentation rolled around. After I finished our PowerPoint, I got UI elements drawn for our inventory window, dialogue bubbles (for the main character and the tree), a health bar, a play/pause button (for the pause menu), and buttons for the main menu and pause screens. (I drew these art assets using my new drawing tablet and a combination of Paint Tool SAI and PhotoShop Portable CS2.) I built our main menu screen in our Unity project and added background music to the main menu and main game.
