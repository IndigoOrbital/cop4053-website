This week we presented our first playable iteration of our project to the class over Zoom. Our team finally settled on a 2D platformer playstyle for our game. We're happy that we've finally arrived on the right track and satisfied with how game production is going (although we'll have to speed up production from here on out).

Some of our members ran into issues with Unity this week which slowed down production right when we were in the middle of a rush period. One of our team members, who had made significant progress on the project but hadn't backed it up, had their Unity file become corrupted (due to a C# code plugin update breaking the file). He had to redownload Unity multiple times and reimport all of our assets into a new Unity file. Another member ran into an issue where clicking play on the Unity scene was affecting her mouse state positioning, but it seemed to be a minor issue that was solved with a computer restart.

This week I put a lot of focus into completing our UI assets before our first playable presentation rolled around. After I finished our PowerPoint, I got UI elements drawn for our inventory window, dialogue bubbles (for the main character and the tree), a health bar, a play/pause button (for the pause menu), and buttons for the main menu and pause screens. (I drew these art assets using my new drawing tablet and a combination of Paint Tool SAI and PhotoShop Portable CS2.) I built our main menu screen in our Unity project and added background music to the main menu and main game.
