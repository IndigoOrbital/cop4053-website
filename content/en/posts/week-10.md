Our second exam took place Monday of this week, so we were able to spend a minimal amount of this week studying. We all went around and shared the link to our Google Forms playtest survey with our friends to get feedback on the current state of our game. We met to dicuss the results and drafted up documents containing the survey results and our plans moving forward in development. During the weekend, we were able to make some additional progress on our game's snowy area.

Like most of the team, I spent my Monday studying in last-minute preparation for our exam. I met with everyone else to pitch some ideas for our playtesting iteration plan and was able to show a few videos of bugs that our playtesters were able to catch. I spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to replicate the bug where the player gets stuck in the floor, and we're still not entirely sure what exactly causes it.
