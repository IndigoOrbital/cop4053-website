This week we had a class exam, so our thoughts were on that until we finished it. As a team, we decided that our work in trying to create an isometric game as we had originally planned wasn't being met with much success. We met up and decided that we'd try to convert the game to a tower defense game to make full of use of Unity's 3D features. We're not sure if it was because of the assets we were using or our lack of planning in trying to convert our game style that caused it, but our initial attempts to make to make a tower defense version of our game just didn't feel right. 

That weeekend we met as a group again and decided that converting our game style to a 2D platformer would be the best way to preserve the original feel of our game, maintain use of the art assets we had already made, and ensure our game was still fun and engaging. We were on a time crunch with our first playable presentation less than a week away, so we decided to move ahead in development temporarily using freely available online assets to work on game functionality.

After the whole debacle this week of trying to decide which style of game we were switching to, I had to start thinking of UI designs. I sketched out a few of these ideas, including ideas for the speech bubbles and menu buttons. Our team was engaged in constant communication this week as we tried to figure out what mechanics and art assets needed to be amended to make the switch from an isometric game to a 2D platformer game.

## Sketches
A rough sketch of the dialogue bubble for when characters are speaking in-game, drawn by Michaela. A colored shadow will be added under these speech bubbles to indicate who in the game is talking, and the bubble will flip in their direction.

A concept sketch of the weapon we'll be using in game and how the aniamtions for it will function, when we were debating whether the main character's weapon should be a sword or spear, drawn by Will.
