In our final (full) week of development, we were able to finish up our game's third area, the lava area. The plant assets associated with the lava area were finished this week and enemy behavior was fully scripted. We added a game over screen, additional dialogue, and an official ending to our game.

I finalized the lava area's level design and placed the finished scripted enemies throughout the area. I contributed to the tutorial dialogue and did some more playtesting, which uncovered a few more minor ladder bugs that were quickly fixed.
